    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! I’m a fiery and inquisitive 24-year-old redhead who grew up in the heart of the Bible Belt. While I deeply respect the traditions and social norms I was raised with, I’m constantly seeking to challenge them in meaningful and functional ways. My passions lie in advocating for mental health, supporting children in difficult situations, and addressing homelessness and poverty within communities.</p>
    <p>Art has always been a cornerstone of my life, and I pair that creativity with a strong foundation in business and marketing. I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing with a specialization in Digital Marketing from the charming liberal arts institution, Francis Marion University. During my studies, I worked with real-life clients such as United Way, Sonoco, The Business School of FMU, and other local small businesses and schools. My team and I developed comprehensive business strategies, marketing plans, social media content, website designs, surveys, and product growth models.</p>
    <p>Professionally, I’m well-versed in tools like Canva, Adobe Illustrator, and Procreate. I also thrive in social and collaborative environments—building meaningful connections with people comes naturally to me. Whether I’m creating a digital masterpiece or brainstorming innovative solutions to social challenges, my ultimate goal is to make a positive impact and empower others.</p>
